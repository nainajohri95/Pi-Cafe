This is Picafe's POS application. Currently it includes login page which have basic validations for empty fields and password length. After clicking on login, user will be redirected to order options screen by default as it only includes UI and not api integration. APi logic is commented till api will be integrated. After redirecting on options screen user can navigate to different pages. Also a page not found page has also been integrated for invalid urls.
